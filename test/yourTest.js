  /** 
   * Implement the following TESTS and ENDPOINTS:
   * 
   * 1. An endpoint which returns all players sorted by score in descending order.
   * 
   * 2. An endpoint which updates all players with a given team name to another team name.
   *    For example, all those with a team name RED changed to PURPLE.
   *
   * 3. An endpoint which returns players grouped by team and team total score and sorted by score descending
   *    The response data structure should be like:
   * 
   *    "teams" : [
   *        {
   *          "name": "a", 
   *          "totalScore": 11000
   *        } ...
   * 
   *      ]
   * 
   * Protip 1: You have to implement the calculation of total score
   * Protip 2: Create two new classes into data-folder which represent the return value.
   
   * 3. An endpoint which returns players grouped by team and team total score and sorted by score descending AND team member information
   *    The response data structure should be like:
   * 
   *    "teams" : [
   *        {
   *          "name": "a", 
   *          "totalScore": 11000
   *          "members": [
   *            {
   *              "uuid": "uuid_10",
   *              "name": "Malcolm Doe",
   *              "createdAtYear": "2020"
   *            }
   *          ]
   *        } ...
   * 
   *      ]
   * 
   * Protip 1: Use the same calculation logic for team score as in the above test case
   * Protip 2: Think what data classes you can reuse from the above test case.
   * Protip 3: Do not use the player.js class in the member.
